# capacity-r

After playing around with python discrete event simulation on [capacity](https://github.com/mesflores/capacity) I found myself with a computer with more cores. Then I read about *parallel* discrete event simulation and [ROSS](http://github.com/carothersc/ROSS), so here we are I guess. The goal is to use the ROSS framework to model transit systems using GTFS data as input.

It's possible ROSS isn't quite right for this, but we'll find out!

The current code here is largely from the ross [template model](https://github.com/nmcglohon/template-model).
